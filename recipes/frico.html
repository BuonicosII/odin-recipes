        <h2>What is Frico?</h2>
        <p>Frico is a traditional dish of Friuli, a region in north-east Italy, 
            consisting mainly of heated cheese and, optionally, other ingredients, 
            such as potatoes. Originally frico was prepared in the impoverished region
             as a way of recycling cheese rinds. There are two popular versions of the 
             dish: one soft and thick, which is usually served in slices and the other 
             thin and crunchy, which can be used either as a garnish or as an appetizer.
              While the soft version has a long tradition, the history of the thin version 
              is disputed. The first recipes for frico date to around 1450 by Maestro Martino,
               cook of the camerlengo of the Aquileia patriarch.</p>
