        <h2>How to cook Frico</h2>
        <p>You take aged cheese (montasio, dairy or malga) from 6 to 12 months 
            and grate it or cut it into pieces. Heat a lightly greased iron pan
             (or a non-stick pan) and spread a handful of cheese, the onions 
             and potatoes in a thin and uniform layer (depending on the size 
             of the pan and the quantity of cheese, the layer it will be almost 
             circular with a diameter of 10 to 15 centimeters).</p>
        <p>It is pressed with a spatula to release the excess fat and, when it is 
            golden brown, it is carefully removed (so as not to break it) from the 
            pan and browned on the other side. Remove from the pan and let cool on 
            absorbent kitchen paper. The result is a crumbly and very tasty cheese 
            biscuit. Traditionally, cooking took place on a wood stove; excellent 
            results are still obtained on gas or electric burners.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Montasio Cheese</li>

            <li>Peel the potatoes and grate them</li>
            <li>Mince the onions and have them fry in the pan with a bit of oil, salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Put the grated - unkooked - potatoes in the pan, and keep mixing and kneading them
                for about half an our, until potatoes and onions mix in a uniform mass.
            </li>

            <li>Keep mixing the ingredients to achieve a uniform mix. The Frico will cook in the molten fat coming from the cheese (if it is too much, remove it).</li>
            <li>Flip the Frico when a crust has formed below.</li>
            <li>when the crust has formed on both sides, the Frico is ready to be served.</li>
