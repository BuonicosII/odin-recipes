        <h2>What is polenta?</h2>
        <p>Polenta is a dish of boiled cornmeal that was historically made from other
             grains. The dish comes from Italy. It may be served as a hot porridge, 
             or it may be allowed to cool and solidify into a loaf that can be baked,
              fried, or grilled. The variety of cereal used is usually yellow maize,
               but often buckwheat, white maize, or mixtures thereof may be used. 
               Coarse grinds make a firm, coarse polenta; finer grinds make a soft, 
               creamy polenta.[4] Polenta is a staple of Northern Italian, Swiss and 
               Balkan (where it is called kačamak or žganci) cuisines (and, to a lesser 
               extent, the Central Italian one, e.g. Tuscany) and its consumption was 
               traditionally associated with lower classes, as in times past cornmeal 
               mush was an essential food in their everyday nutrition</p>
